C-- Compiler
=========

> This is a project for Compiler-Principles.

C-- compiler is a compiler based on the "C--" language.It supports partial C89 language features.

## C-- language features
The "C--" language, which is cut from the C89 language, support the features as follow:

1.Type of variable: 
- interger, single-precision float
- array and structure

2.Basic syntax :
- if ( expression ) statement
- if ( expression ) statement else statement
- while ( expression ) statment

Attention! The "C--" grammer doesn't support pointer!

## Build 
    Run "make" to build 

## Run the "C--" compiler
    ./build/bin/parser \<your-test-filename\>

## Any advise would be appreciated :)
