# Compiler-Principles-Lab
My compiler can scan file that is based on the alleged "c--" grammer.
It will extract leximal token from that file and pass the token to parser.

## How to build this project
Just download this project to your computer and input "make" to the terminal, there will be a executable flie call "parser".
## Show me your alleged "c--" parser
./parser \<your-test-filename\>
## What's the "c--" grammer
Well,it can be considered as a grammer that is cutted from "c" grammer.

> Any advise would be appreciated :)
