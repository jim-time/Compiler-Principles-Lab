# C-- Compiler
> This is a project for Compiler-Principles.
C-- compiler is a compiler for the "C--" language.It's intended to support partial C89 language features.

## C-- language features
The "C--" language, which is cut from the C89 language, support the features as follow:
- basic type for variable: interger, single-precision float
- array and structure
- basic syntax :
-- if ( expression ) statement
-- if ( expression ) statement else statement
-- while ( expression ) statment

Pay attention! The "C--" grammer doesn't support pointer!

## Build
> Download this project to your computer 
> Input "make" to the terminal 

## How to run this alleged "c--" parser
./parser \<your-test-filename\>

## Any advise would be appreciated :)
